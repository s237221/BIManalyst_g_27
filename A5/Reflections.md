# Own level: 

Both group participants agree that they started at the level: BIM Analyst and ended up in the Self Learner level, as it has been a steep learning curve of the ifcOpenshell library. 

# What else do you still need to learn? 

Both participants agree that a deeper knowledge of python and information about to how to efficiently combine python, ifcOpenshell and Bim softwares need to be studied further. 

# How you might use OpenBIM in the future? 

Soon, the codes developed during this course might come in handful in the Advanced  Building Design course, as well as an advantage within the future job market. 

# Development of the tutorial: 

The course had quite a lot of material available and it was overwhelming in the beginning. We believe that a more detailed description of each chapter would have been useful in determining how to use the information in the assignments.  

It was really nice that we had a lot of choices and therefore, more freedom with our assignments. 

We would have preferred to have all the tools into one chapter instead of scattered between the lectures. 

# Summary of feedback: 

The feedback on the tool was mostly positive and we have actually improved on the description part, as we have received a lot of questions about how to give the input data and how to interpret the output data. Therefore, we have decided to create an example of usage of our tool and explain that in the tutorial. We also considered important to mention the limitations of the tool, as it has the potential to be further improved and modified to check other types of elements. 

# Ioana Alexandra Udangiu - s237221: 

I would like to use OpenBIM in my thesis and future career, as that was the motivation for taking the course. I am generally a lazy person and I think that OpenBIM has a lot of potential to automate part of the repetitive tasks in a project. Moreover, the OpenBIM use is extending beyond buildings and there are companies developing BIM tools for bridges and LCA and OpenBIM will play an important role in working with the tools and models created. 

I believe that we have worked well as a team and that we have learned more about OpenBIM and python. I personally did not have a lot of knowledge about python and in the beginning of the course I did not even know that ifcOpenShell existed, so I believe it to be quite an improvement. Even though the tool is not complicated, it took some time to research the functions needed to extract the dimensions of the columns and the elevation and to figure out how to make them work together. 

# Yao Tong – s232288: 

My thesis likely involves the topic that do not require this tool, therefore I don’t think I will use it in my thesis. 

However, in my next ten years, OpenBIM is becoming increasingly important in the professional workflow where collaboration between multiple stakeholders. Even if I am not directly working on OpenBIM, understanding and being familiar with this tool is still quite critical. 

Last semester I took the course Advanced Building Design to help me learn how to design and construct a building in a professional way, then this course help me recognize the growing importance of collaborative tool for multiple stakeholders. Experienced these assignments, I have deep understanding concerning transferring the professional language to the ordinary language. And in the meanwhile, using the OpenBIM to check the data of the model is also a good idea.
